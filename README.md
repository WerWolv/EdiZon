A Homebrew save file dumper, injector and on-console editor for Horizon, the OS of the Nintendo Switch. 
Please note if you are using Atmosphere 0.10.0+, you **must** to use the snapshot version of EdiZon. Older versions of EdiZon do **not** work on the latest Atmosphere.

    - Injection of extracted game saves (Your own and your friends save files).
    - Uploading of savefiles directly to https://anonfile.com.
    - Batch extraction of all save files of all games on the system.
  - **Save file editing**
    - Easy to use, scriptable and easily expandable on-console save editing.
      - Lua and Python script support.
    - Built-in save editor updater.
  - **On-the-fly memory editing**
    - Cheat Engine like RAM editing.

# Save editor Config and Script files

  To download working Editor Config and Editor Script files, visit [this repository](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon_ConfigsAndScripts/tree/master)

  Check out our [Wiki page](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon/wiki) for more information on how to build your own Editor Config and Editor Script files.

# How to install

  1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon/releases/latest).
  2. Unpack the downloaded zip file, put the files on your Nintendo Switch's SD card and let the folders merge.
  3. Use a free open source CFW like [Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) to launch the hbmenu and start EdiZon from there.
     1. If you want to use the cheat manager you absolutely have to use [Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) as only their cheats are supported.
     2. For the best experience, open the `/atmosphere/system_settings.ini` file and change `dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default = u8!0x1` to `dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default = u8!0x0`.


# How to compile

  1. Clone the EdiZon repo to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon`.
  2. Download and install devkitA64. It comes bundled with the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) toolchain.
  3. Use the pacman package manager that comes with devkitPro to download and install libNX, portlibs (`switch-portlibs`) and freetype2 (`switch-freetype`).
  4. The rest of the compilation works using the `make` command.
