If you experience any issues or if you're a save editor developer it's possible to get some
debug output from EdiZon. The easiest way to do this is by using nxlink which comes with the
devkitpro toolchain. Alternatively you can create a file called EdiZon.log in the /switch/EdiZon
folder on your SD card to redirect all console output into that file.
