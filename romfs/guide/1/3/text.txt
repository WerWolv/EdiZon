Save file backups are useful if you want to save your current progress in a game so you can 
return back to it at a later point or if you're worried about your switch getting stolen or 
destroyed in some way. EdiZon is particularly helpful in for the latter since it's possible 
to create a batch backup which includes all save files for all games and all users on the 
system.
