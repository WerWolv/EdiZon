There are two different types of multi-save backups. 

The first one will create a backup containing all save files of all users for one specific 
game. To do this hover over a game's icon in EdiZon's main menu and press the (X) button. 
The keyboard will pop up asking you for a name for the backup. After entering the save files 
will get copied to /switch/EdiZon/batch. 
 
The second type is called a batch backup. It will create a backup of all save files on the system. 
This can be done by holding down the (ZR) button while pressing the (X) button in the EdiZon 
main menu. A warning will pop up and after accepting, the save files will be copied into 
/switch/EdiZon/batch.
