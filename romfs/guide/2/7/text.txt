For a game save file to be editable, somebody has to make a config/script for it. If you're 
lucky and your game is supported, editing it is very straight forward. 
 
First of all to find out which ones of your currently installed games are editable, press the 
(ZL) button in the EdiZon main menu. In this mode only games that have a config installed will 
get shown. To edit a save file now, select the game in this list as if you wanted to backup it's 
save file. In the new menu, press the (-) button and select the save file you want to edit. 
The editor will now pop up where you can edit all the values shown to you. 

Make your changes and once you're done, press the (X) button to apply the changed values.
