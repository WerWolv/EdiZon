To create a single backup of a game's save data, select the game you want to backup 
the save files for in the EdiZon main menu and select the user the save belongs to. In the newly 
opened interface, press the (X) button to create a backup. The keyboard will pop up where you can 
enter a custom name for the backup folder. By default the current date and time will be used. 
Afterwards you'll have the choice to upload the save file to anonfile.com in which case you'll 
receive a console-unique key that can be entered on https://edizon.werwolv.net to access all files. 
The save file will get stored in /switch/EdiZon/saves/<titleID> in both cases.
